The project result was an online event calendar system for Trail Life USA (TLUSA) and the organization’s members. The calendar system, named “Online Adventure Finder” or OAF, provides detailed information about scheduled events and activities, including locations, dates, and categories associated with the event. The project was completed at Fresno Pacific University during the Spring 2018 semester of the pilot Computer Information Systems Degree Completion program.
